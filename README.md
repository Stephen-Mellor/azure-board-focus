# azure-board-focus

## Motivation

Do you and your team use Azure DevOps? Do you find that when someone else is sharing a Board, especially if you are viewing via a large screen in an office, then the content can be quite unreadable? And even if you were to try to manually zoom in, the elements you were trying to enlarge remained the same size whilst everything else grew larger?

`azure-board-focus` was born from this frustration. The original idea was to have a single button browser extension that would remove the elements surrounding the board, allowing the content to take up the whole screen. However, extra features were added such as

- auto-expanding of swimlanes
- increasing font sizing in places
- extra modes, such as one that will move the closed column horizontally to the top (really useful for a team whose tester is first to speak!)
